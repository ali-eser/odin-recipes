            <p><i><small>This stew is a much better use of Alstrooms than stuffing them into your
                magic flask and accidentally triggering Cursecast!</small></i></p>

                    <li>2 tsp oregano (4g)</li>
                    <li>dashes of white pepper and paprika (optional)</li>

                    <li>flour</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to</h4>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>In a pot, melt the butter on medium heat. Add onions and cook
                        until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes</li>
                    <li>Add garlic and ginger and cook for a few more minutes, until
                        fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook
                        until soft and add the wine.</li>
                    <li>Cook for a few minutes, then add vegetable/chicken stock and bring
                        to boil. Slowly stir in the half-and-half and heavy cream.</li>
                    <li>Add the fresh thyme leaves and oregano. Stir in white pepper and
                        paprika, if using. Add the scallions, reserving a handful for the
                        garnish.</li>
                    <li>Cover and simmer for 5 minutes until the stew thickens. If it doesn't
                        thicken to your liking, slowly stir in a few tbsp of flour, one at a time,
                        until thickened. Remember to continue seasoning with salt and
                        pepper, to taste.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with scallion slices. Enjoy on its own or over rice!</li>
