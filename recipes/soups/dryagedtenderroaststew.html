            <h4>How to</h4>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>Season short ribs with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Heat a large dutch-
                        oven and sear short-ribs until golden brown on each side. Remove
                        
                        to a plate, and add onion, garlic, and butter to pan, cooking until
                        softened. Sprinkle in flour, stirring to combine.</li>
                    <li>Pour in wine and bring to a boil, scraping up caramelized bits from
                        the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Stir in remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, pop the lid on and
                        reduce to a simmer. Simmer for about an hour and a half or until
                        short ribs and veggies are fork tender.</li>
            </ol></small>
