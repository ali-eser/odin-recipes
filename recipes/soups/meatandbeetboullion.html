            <h4>How to</h4>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>Put beef in large pot with 9 cups (2L) of cold water and salt. Bring
                        to a boil, skimming foam off the surface. Reduce heat, cover, and
                        simmer 50 minutes, regularly skimming more foam.</li>
                    <li>Finely chop or use food processor to “puree” beets. Mix with
                        vinegar, sugar, and tomato paste in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Sauté onion with olive oil for 2 minutes, then add grated carrots
                        and sauté another 3 minutes or until soft.</li>
                    <li>After the meat has simmered 50 minutes, add potatoes and simmer
                        for 10 minutes. Add beets, cabbage, onions, carrots, and diced
                        tomatoes. Cook another 10 minutes. Stir in parsley, pepper, and
                        garlic. Add bay leaves and salt to taste, then cover and remove pot
                        from heat. Let stand 20 minutes. Remove bay leaves and garlic and
                        garnish with sour cream and dill.</li>
