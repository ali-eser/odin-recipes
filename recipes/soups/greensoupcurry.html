            <h4>Ingredients for green curry paste</h4>
        <small><ul>
                    <li>4.5 tbsp coriander seeds (25g)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp mace powder or ginger powder (5g)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp cumin seeds (12g)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp nutmeg powder (2.5g)</li>
                    <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>5 shallots</li>
                    <li>2 lemongrass stalks</li>
                    <li>3 green finger chilies (or 5 normal green chilies)</li>
                    <li>bunch of coriander (to taste)</li>
                    <li>4 kaffir lime leaves</li>
                    <li>2 tsp galangal paste (10mL)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt (2.5g)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp shrimp paste (15g)</li>
                    <li>4 basil leaves</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to make green curry paste</h4>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>Heat up a dry pan and put in the coriander seeds, mace, cumin
                        seeds, and nutmeg powder. Keep stirring to prevent mixture from
                        burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Stir until the mixture becomes a beautiful golden color and the
                        aroma of the spices is the air. Remove from the heat and set aside
                        to cool.</li>
                    <li>Flatten and remove the skin from the garlic. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Peel the shallots and chop them into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>To prepare the lemongrass, cut off the bulb part of the lemongrass
                        until you can see the purple ring inside and remove the hard outer
                        layer. Cut off the lower, paler area of the lemongrass and chop the
                        rest finely.</li>
                    <li>Chop up the chilies and remove all the seeds (because these are
                        really spicy).</li>
                    <li>Roughly chop up the coriander and the kaffir lime leaves.</li>
                    <li>Use a pestle and mortar to grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds,
                        nutmeg, and mace together. Do so by lightly but firmly tapping
                        down on the seeds until flattened, and then start grinding them.
                        Continue to pound and grind until it is a semi-fine powder. Set
                        aside.</li>
                    <li>Mash the garlic into a pulp using the pestle and mortar. Add
                        shallots to garlic and pulp and grind as well.</li>
                    <li>Slowly introduce the other green ingredients, including the
                        lemongrass, chilis, coriander, and kaffir.</li>
                    <li>Spoon in the galangal paste and salt. Continue to grind with pestle
                        and mortar.</li>
                    <li>Introduce the shrimp paste, and then the ground spices from earlier.</li>
                    <li>Add a handful of basil leaves and crush it as well.</li>
            </ol></small>
