            <p><i><small>By using lumpfish caviar as opposed to a more expensive kind, you'll
                be able to avoid having to take on endless hunts just to afford this
                fancy French-Altissian dish!</small></i></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <small><ul>
                <li>1 jar lumpfish (or other) caviar</li>
                <li>1 baguette</li>
                <li>lettuce</li>
                <li>1 leek</li>
                <li>1 red onion</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to</h4>
            <small><ol>
                <li>Cut the baguette to the desired thickness, about 1 inch (2.5cm).
                    Brown the baguette slices under a grill or in a toaster. Be careful
                    not to burn the edges. Each baguette slice forms the base of one
                    canapé.</li>
                <li>Wash, dry, and then tear the lettuce leaves into the desired shape.
                    Cover the toasted baguette slices with the lettuce leaves.</li>
                <li>Cut the leek and separate them into thin slices. Blanch the slices to
                    soften them and mellow the flavor. Flatten the slices out after you
                    fish them out from the water and place one slice top of each
                    canapé.</li>
                <li>Slice one half of the onion, as thinly as possible. Place about three
                    onion half-rings onto each canapé.</li>    
                <li>Scoop some caviar from the jar, and using either the back of
                    another spoon or your pinky finger, slide the caviar carefully onto a
                    canapé. Try to keep the caviar piled, and don't spread it around.
                    Repeat for all canapés.</li>
                <li>Serve!</li>
            </ol></small>
