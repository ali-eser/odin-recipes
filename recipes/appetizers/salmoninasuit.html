            <p><i><small>This salmon is totally ready to rock that sales presentation!</small></i></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <small><ul>
                <li>1 small salmon fillet, about 6oz (170g)</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp Japanese rice wine or white wine</li>
                <li>2tsp honey</li>
                <li>2tsp miso paste</li>
                <li>1⁄2 cup uncooked sushi rice (100g)</li>
                <li>3-4 pieces of approx. 2 x 10 in (5cm x 25cm) nori</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to</h4>
        <small><ol>
                <li>Mix soy sauce, wine, honey, and miso paste together in a ziplock
                    bag. Add salmon and marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, wash the rice in a strainer. If using a pot to cook the
                    rice, first soak rice in water for 15-20 minutes. Cook rice in a rice
                    cooker, or in a pot, using your favorite method of cooking. Set aside
                    and let cool whenever it finishes cooking.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Place salmon, skin side down, on a
                    foil-lined pan and bake until the salmon is just cooked through,
                    about 10-12 minutes (test for doneness with fork).</li>
                <li>Remove salmon from oven. Break the salmon apart in a bowl into
                    little pieces with a fork.</li>
                <li>Prepare a bowl of cold water. To keep the rice from sticking to your
                    hands when forming the rice balls, periodically keep your hands wet
                    using this water.</li>
                <li>Take a large handful of the cooked rice with your hands. Flatten the
                    rice until it is about half an inch thick (1.5cm), and add a bit of
                    salmon filling to the center. Fold the rice in half so the filling is
                    hidden.</li>
                <li>Gently mould the rice into a soft triangular shape with your palms.
                    Leave a small indent on the top corner of the triangle.</li>
                <li>Wrap the center of the piece of nori around the back of the triangle,
                    then fold the edges towards the front and tuck under the triangle to
                    create a “suit” shape. Set triangle on plate and add a ball of salmon
                    filling to the top of the triangle. Repeat for remaining filling/rice -
                    this should yield 3-4 suits. Enjoy!</li>
