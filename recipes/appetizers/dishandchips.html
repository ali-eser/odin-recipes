            <p><i><small>This is one of Noct's favorite dishes. Too bad nobody ever told him that
                potatoes are botanically classified as a vegetable...</small></i></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <small><ul>
                <li>2 medium russet potatoes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil (15mL)</li>
                <li>1⁄2 tsp salt (1.5g)</li>
                <li>(optional) chili powder, to taste</li>
                <li>(optional) cumin, to taste</li>
                <li>(optional) black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>(optional) other desired seasonings, to taste</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to</h4>
            <small><ol>
                <li>Thoroughly wash (and optionally peel) the potatoes. Using a very
                    sharp knife, cut the potatoes length-wise into thin fries,
                    approximately 1⁄4 inches (6mm) wide.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Add the fries to a large bowl and cover with cold water.
                    Soak for 30 minutes (or up to overnight in the fridge) to remove
                    excess potato starch. While this step isn’t technically necessary, the
                    resulting fries will be more delicious. If you’re in a hurry, you can
                    also rinse the fries to remove surface starch.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Drain and rinse the fries, then pat
                    dry using paper towels. In a large (dry) bowl, add the fries, oil, and
                    seasonings. Gently toss.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Place
                    the fries on the sheet such that ideally there are no overlapping
                    fries.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 minutes. Flip the fries with a spatula for even baking,
                    and continue baking for another 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Increase the oven heat to 425°F (218°C), and continue baking for
                    another 10-15 minutes, until the outside edges look a little burnt.</li>
                <li>Remove, let cool, and enjoy!</li>
