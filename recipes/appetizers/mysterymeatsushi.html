            <p><i><small>While the origins of the meat in this sushi might forever remain a
                mystery on Eos, here on Earth it is commonly referred to as Spam
                musubi, a popular Hawaiian dish.</small></i></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <small><ul>
                <li>11⁄4 - 11⁄2 cups uncooked rice (250-300g)</li>
                <li>1⁄2 - 3⁄4 can of Spam (keep the can)</li>
                <li>2 eggs (1⁄2 egg per musubi)</li>
                <li>1⁄2 tbsp cooking oil (7.5mL)</li>
                <li>(optional) salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1 piece of nori, cut into 4 1 inch (2.5cm) wide pieces</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h4>How to</h4>
        <small><ol>
                <li>Set the rice to cook.</li>
                <li>Cut the spam to the desired thickness and fry until surface is brown.</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg in a bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>In a heated and oiled pan, pour half an egg in a thin layer. When it
                    is almost cooked, use a pair of chopsticks to fold it approximately
                    into the size of the spam slice, or bigger.</li>
                <li>When the rice is cooked, season with salt, if desired, and fluff the
                    rice with a wet rice paddle.</li>
                <li>Line the inside of the Spam can with plastic wrap, and fill with rice
                    up to the top of the spam can. Do not compact rice before reaching
                    the top.</li>
                <li>Press the rice down with a spoon or your fingers, until compacted. If
                    the rice starts to stick, dampen the spoon or finger. Remove the rice
                    from the can by pulling on the plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Assemble the sushi as shown above, making sure the seaweed is
                    long enough to wrap around the spam and egg to stick onto the
                    bottom of the rice. Repeat steps 6-8 to make 3-4 sushi.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol></small>
