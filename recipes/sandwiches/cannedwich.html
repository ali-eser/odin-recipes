            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <h5>To make the sandwich</h5>
        <small><ul>
                    <li>2 slices of white bread, moderately thick</li>
                    <li>canola oil (for pan frying)</li>
                    <li>2 slices of Spam, about 0.6in thick (1.5cm)</li>
                    <li>2 slices sandwich cheddar cheese slice</li>
            </ul></small>
            <h5>How to (cannedwich)</h5>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>Cut 2 slices of white bread into half, remove the bread crust, then
                        toast the bread in toaster until lightly brown.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan over medium heat and add some canola oil. When it's
                        ready, pan fry the Spam slices until golden brown and crisp on top.</li>
                    <li>Cut the sandwich cheddar cheese slices into the shape of the
                        bread and Spam. Then, place the cheese slice on top of the toasted
                        bread, followed by Spam, then by more cheese, and finally by more
                        toasted bread.</li>
                </ol></small>
            <h5>(Optional) To make the side fries</h5>
        <small><ul>
                    <li>1 russet potato</li>
                    <li>4 cups warm water (960mL)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp corn syrup (30mL)</li>
                    <li>canola oil (for frying)</li>

                </ul></small>
            <h5>How to (side fries)</h5>
        <small><ol>
                    <li>Wash and peel the russet potato skin.</li>
                    <li>Slice into planks about 1⁄3 inch thick (0.8cm), and julienne into
                        sticks.</li>
                    <li>Mix 4 cups (1L) of warm water with 2 tablespoons (30mL) of corn
                        syrup. Soak the potato sticks (aka fries) in the water bath for
                        approximately 30 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
                    <li>Drain the corn syrup water and use kitchen towel to pat off excess
                        water from the fries.</li>
                    <li>Fry the fries using canola oil that has been preheated to 375°F
                        (190°C) for 1.5 minutes (first fry). Remove the fries and drain off
                        excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Increase the oil temperature to 400°F (200°C) and fry the fries
                        again until crispy and golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Use kitchen towel to pat off excess oil, and sprinkle with salt to
                        season the fries.</li>
                </ol></small>

                    <li>3 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
                </ul></small>
